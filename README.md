# Ferula_RNAseq_Analysis
This repository has been created for the down streamning analysis after finalizing assembly.
Dateset is 18 libraries with four tissues (Root, Leaf, Flower, Stem) from three facilities for RNA sequencing  
B BGI
D Davis
N Novagenes
To do differential expression RNAseq analysis with edgeR and deseq2 just on Davis libraries after analyzing expression RNAseq with Kallisto and Salmon, respectively. (becuase of batch effect of different facility for seq)
To do network analyzing for all libraries came from Davis
To do GO analysis for interproscan result
To do GO analysis for b2g result
keep .Rmd just in repository folder, keep input and output outside of this folder
